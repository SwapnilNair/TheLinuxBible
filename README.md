## WHICH DISTRO SHOULD I USE ?
I would recommend one of these options based on your preferred mental state :

#### 1. I would like to keep my sanity 

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and higher 
  - LTS stands for Long Term Support, which guarantees better stability and software updates.The other one will do just fine as well
- POP OS
  - Excellent option for those coming from Windows. Snappy and Fast. Excellent window manager
  - ( Bonus : You can GAME on this since it has support from Nvidia )   
- Zorin OS  
  - Slightly more hands on, but a really good and clean look nonetheless
  - Amazing suite of preinstalled apps
 
 #### 2. I would like to take on something more advanced, my uncle owns an Aspirin warehouse
 - Elementary OS ( Swapnil's Choice )
    - Absolute beauty of a system. 
    - Comes bundled with good software.
    - Impossible to upgrade stuff and don't even think about bringing Nvidia or AMD GPU Drivers near this.
    - Not exactly Ubuntu, so expect to need to dig into system files incase of software installs.
    - (Bonus : I can give you a script to make it look like MacOS BigSur if thats your thing)
 - Manjaro
    - Clean , excellent connectivity options 
    - Less amazing UI  but high customizability
 #### 3. I have too much time to kill 
 - Arch Linux
 - Kali Linux
 - Gentoo
